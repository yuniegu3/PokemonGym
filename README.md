# PokemonGym


PokemonGym 

First group project using previous project.


-Alex-
Changed the class and id structure to incoperate two pokedex instead of one.
Refactored the javascript to reflect those changes and added event listeners on the "new buttons".
Refactored some of the javascript to change how pokemon data was stored and how trainers were instantiated.


-Pair Programing-
Yunie had trouble getting the gifs to go inside the screen container so we decided to do a pair programing and was able to solve it with Alex's knowledge of javascript.
Made wireframe together while brainstorming what ideas we wanted to pull from our personal project.



-Yunie-
Had to spend quite a lot of time to actually undertstand the javascript code since we decided to use Alex's code.
Sorted the scss files.
Made mixins and some variables in scss for organization.
